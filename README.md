### Features

- Check if device is connected to any network (WiFi, Cellular, Ethernet, etc.)
- Determine the specific type of network connection
- Register for real-time network state change callbacks
- Support for Android API levels from 16 to the latest
- Proper null safety handling
- Validation that internet connection actually works

### Installation

Add the required permission to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml 
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" /> 
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
```

### Usage

### Basic Connectivity Check

```kotlin
if (context.isNetworkConnected()) {
    // Network is available
} else {
    // No network connection
}
```

### Get Network Connection Type

```kotlin
when (context.getNetworkType()) {
    NetworkType.WIFI -> // Connected to WiFi
    NetworkType.CELLULAR -> // Connected to mobile data
    NetworkType.ETHERNET -> // Connected to ethernet
    NetworkType.BLUETOOTH -> // Connected via Bluetooth
    NetworkType.VPN -> // Connected through VPN
    NetworkType.NONE -> // No connection
}
```

### Monitor Network Changes

```kotlin
// For API level 21 and above
val networkCallback = context.registerNetworkCallback(
    onAvailable = {
        // Network became available
    },
    onLost = {
        // Network connection lost
    }
)

// Don't forget to unregister when done
context.unregisterNetworkCallback(networkCallback)
```

### Best Practices

- Consider using this utility with LiveData or Flow to create reactive UI updates
- For operations that require network, check connectivity first to provide better user experience
- Implement retry mechanisms for network operations when connectivity is restored
